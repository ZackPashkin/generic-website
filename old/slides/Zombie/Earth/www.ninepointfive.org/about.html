  <h2>Nine Point Five, an earthquake visualization.</h2>
  <h3>What is it?</h3>
  <p>Nine Point Five is an interactive visualization of earthquakes over the
  past 30 years.  It uses the newly developed WebGL technology to create an
  fluid and interactive in-browser experience, chugging through the data and
  presenting these events over an interactive Earth.
  </p>
  <h3>Why can't I view it?</h3>
  <p>You'll need to download and setup a browser that supports WebGL.  Currently
  this means you'll have to <a href="http://khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation">follow a few steps</a> to get the latest development build
  of your favorite browser and enable WebGL support.

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p>Use your mouse and scrollwheel to control our planet Earth.  For a given time range, you will be presented with the most significant earthquakes on the right side panel.  Selecting an earthquake will fly you there, and display more information about that event.</p>
  <p><img src="static/assets/timeline.jpg" width="100" height="32" alt="Timeline" title="Timeline" />Select the time range of data to display, from 1977 to 2010.</p>
  <p><img width="24" height="24" src="static/assets/ico_dots.png" alt="Particles" title="Particles" />Earthquakes are displayed as a particle cloud.</p>
  <p><img width="24" height="24" src="static/assets/ico_lines.png" alt="Lines" title="Lines" />Earthquakes are displayed as lines.</p>
  <p><img width="24" height="24" src="static/assets/ico_circles.png" alt="Rings" title="Rings" />Rings surround the locations of earthquakes, allowing for high detail while you zoom in.</p>
  <p><img width="24" height="24" src="static/assets/tour.png" alt="Tour" title="Tour" />A non-interactive mode (think of it like a screensaver), which
  takes you on a tour of the most significant earthquakes for the current time range.</p>
  <p><img width="145" height="29" src="static/assets/magslider.jpg" alt="Magnitude Filter" title="Magnitude Filter" />Filter earthquakes by increasing magnitude, generally a magnitude over 6 is considered significant.</p>
  <p><img width="145" height="29" src="static/assets/dayslider.jpg" alt="Magnitude Filter" title="Magnitude Filter" />Position the sun, shadowing or lighting Earth.</p>
  <p><img width="24" height="24" src="static/assets/ico_supersampling.png" alt="Supersampling" title="Toggle Supersampling" id="ui_super"/>A techy option to control how anti-aliasing is performed, by default supersampling is enabled.</p>

  <h3>Where's the tanks and guns?</h3>
  <p>The increasing power and availability of graphics
  processors, and the access to them on the web, means more than just games.
  We can now build beautiful interactive experiences in areas that would have
  traditionally not have considered 3D.  Nine Point Five tries to explore this
  new medium with a concentration on the design and integration within the
  page, and an aesthetic that could feel at home in an encyclopedia or news
  article.
  </p>
  <h3>Whose behind it?</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.deanmcnamee.com/">Dean McNamee</a> and <a href="http://marcinignac.com/">Marcin Ignac</a>, two designers working with technology.
